            After school, I studied Media and Communications for Digital
            Business in Aachen, Germany. It was at that time, where I found my
            passion for Design, Technology and being an Entrepreneur. In my free
            time, I always liked to follow my curiosity, learn new things and
            explore the far corners of the internet. Currently, I'm spending my
            day on while dedicating my evenings read books, write articles, code
            things and spend time with my favorite people in life.
