# danielwirtz.com

Welcome behind the curtain of my personal website/portfolio. Take a look around.

This website is build using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)(React Framework), [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com)(Component Library) and [Airtable](https://airtable.com/invite/r/HsvqbADg) as a simple backend. (e.g for the books page)

I think the most interesting pages to look at are:

- https://danielwirtz.com/books
- https://danielwirtz.com/tools

## Get it running locally

To get this website running locally, type this into your terminal:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/wirtzdan/website danielwirtz.com
$ cd danielwirtz.com
$ yarn
$ yarn dev
```

Make sure to add environmental variables, if you want to play around with the [Airtable](https://airtable.com/invite/r/HsvqbADg)and [Raindrop](https://raindrop.io) integration.
