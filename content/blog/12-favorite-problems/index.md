There is a constant battle in my life between all the things that interest me and the painful realisation that time is a finite resource. I'm continuously bumping against this problem when I try to juggle too many things at once.

To give you an impression, let's take a look at what I'm trying to spend time with at the moment:

1. Programming a chrome extension for Roam Research
2. Reading about cultural evolution in the evening (This book)
3. Practising Dutch (Just moved to the Netherlands)
4. Sticking to a consistent body-weight routine
5. Meditating every morning and being mindful throughout the day
6. Leading and growing Crisp Studio
7. Building a second brain in Roam Research
8. Growing indoor sprouts that we can harvest for salad

This list isn't even complete, but I think it gets the point across. I'm grateful to have some many things to work on because that way it never gets boring. But this also creates a constant flood of information and forces me to quickly jump between different contexts.

I recently stumbled upon the idea of having 12 favourite problems through Tiago Forte. The idea originally goes back to Richard Feynman. The main goal of this method is to prime your brain with problems you care most about. This then helps you to structure your attention and to navigate the flood of information.

> "You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps. Every once in a while there will be a hit, and people will say, ‘How did he do it? He must be a genius!" – Richard Feynman

It took me some time to think about my favourite problems, but eventually, I ended up with a list of 10 questions. Here they are:

1. How can I live in harmony with nature?
2. How can I aintain a joyful and loving relationship?
3. How can I stay physically and mentally healthy?
4. How can I be an active part of a community?
5. How can I create strong social bonds with the people around me?
6. How can I become financially independent?
7. How can I build a company that maximises the value for both the outside and inside?
8. How can I learn from what others have already figured out?
9. How can I understand our human nature?
10. How can I find the most effective way to do good for our society?
11. How can I sharpen my ability to think clearly?
12. How can I learn to code?

I went with a very balanced approach. The problems range from topics like Career, Love, Finances to things like Health, Learning and Social Life. I believe this is a good approach because it creates a strong foundation for a meaningful and good life.

But the key here is to be focused on those questions and to be consistent. I doubt that I will be able to have the best answers for all of those questions at all the time. But if I'm consistent and taking care of all those questions, it will create a compound effect throughout my lifetime. At least that would be the plan.
