            I'm a curious mind with many interests. I like to immerse myself
            into one topic, but quickly jump to the next when I get bored.
            Learning gives me the most satisfaction and is a common pattern in
            my life. I studied Media and Communications for Digital Business
            (Heck, that's long...) in Aachen and still, live there today.

          Back in university, I co-founded a company called{" "}
          <a href="https://crisp.studio">Crisp Studio</a>. Over time the company
          evolved into a small, expert studio for Design Sprints. In my role as
          a CEO, I focus on business strategy, team-alignment and running a
          healthy company. When I'm involved in client projects I'm mostly
          designing and prototyping products.
